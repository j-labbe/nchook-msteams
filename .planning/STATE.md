### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase structure following architectural boundary (nchook engine -> wrapper -> operations)
- [Roadmap]: State persistence (CONF-02..04) assigned to Phase 1 since nchook owns the state engine
- [Roadmap]: Config file loading (CONF-01) assigned to Phase 2 since wrapper consumes config for filtering/webhook
